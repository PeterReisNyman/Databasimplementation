# Best U.S. Locations for a Real Estate Bird-Dogging Business

**Real estate bird-dogging** involves finding undervalued or distressed properties for investors in exchange for a fee. Success depends heavily on choosing the right market. Below are the key factors considered, followed by the top U.S. locations (ranked) that excel in these areas:

- **Abundance of Distressed Properties:** Markets with high foreclosure rates or many fixer-uppers offer more leads for bird dogs.  
- **Strong Investor Demand:** Areas where flippers and rental investors are actively buying (often evidenced by low days-on-market and bidding wars).  
- **Active, Competitive Market:** A high number of real estate transactions and agents indicates a vibrant, liquid market (though competitive, it means deals move quickly).  
- **Quick Sales Potential:** Markets where homes sell fast ensure any deals found can be sold or assigned rapidly, benefiting investors and bird dogs alike.  
- **Affordability:** Lower-cost markets allow a beginner to start with minimal funds (e.g. a $200 marketing budget) since property leads and advertising tend to be cheaper, and thereâ€™s less financial barrier to entry.

Based on these factors, here are the top locations and why they are ideal for a bird-dogging business:

## 1. Cleveland, Ohio ðŸ‡ºðŸ‡¸  
**Why Itâ€™s Great:** Cleveland offers a rare combination of **extremely high supply of distressed homes** and solid buyer demand.

At the same time, **housing demand is outpacing supply** â€“ Clevelandâ€™s booming healthcare and research sectors have drawn in buyers, and inventory is tight.
