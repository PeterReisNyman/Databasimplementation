I'll gather nationwide data on home sales as a percentage of total housing stock from August 2024 to February 2025. The results will be presented in tables to show the regions with the highest activity. I'll let you know when the analysis is ready.

# U.S. Home Sales Turnover (Aug 2024 – Feb 2025)

The U.S. housing market saw historically low turnover in late 2024, with only about **2.5% of homes (25 out of 1,000)** changing owners nationally in the first eight months of 2024 ([With Election Coming, U.S. Sees Lowest Home Turnover Rate In Decades - The Mortgage Note](https://www.themortgagenote.org/with-election-coming-u-s-sees-lowest-home-turnover-rate-in-decades/#:~:text=Just%202.5,uncertainty%20kept%20people%20in%20place))  Despite the overall slowdown, **some regions still had relatively high home-sales activity** compared to their total housing stock. In particular, **Sun Belt states** and certain metro areas (especially in the South and suburban Northeast) led in the **percentage of homes sold** relative to the housing inventory ([U.S. Home Turnover Rate Is Lowest It's Been In At Least 30 Years – NMP](https://nationalmortgageprofessional.com/news/us-home-turnover-rate-lowest-its-been-least-30-years#:~:text=A%20number%20of%20Sun%20Belt,%2835%20of%20every%201%2C000))  Below we present the top states and metropolitan areas by this turnover percentage, along with the number of homes sold and total housing stock for context.

## Top States by Home Sales Percentage (Late 2024)

Even as turnover hit a 30-year low nationally, a few states stood out with higher-than-average sales activity relative to their housing stock. These were largely **Sun Belt** states or those with **popular metro areas** where more households were buying and selling homes. The table below lists estimates for the top states, with the number of homes sold (approx. Aug 2024–Feb 2025), total housing units, and the percentage of housing stock sold in that period:

| **State**        | **Homes Sold (approx.)** | **Total Housing Stock**    | **Turnover Rate** (Homes Sold ÷ Housing Stock) |

## Top Metropolitan Areas by Home Sales Percentage (Late 2024)

At the metro level, **Phoenix** had the nation’s highest home turnover rate in this period. Several other metros – particularly in the Sun Belt and the greater New York area – also saw a larger portion of homes change hands despite the slow market. The table below highlights the top five metropolitan areas by percentage of housing stock sold (turnover), along with the number of homes sold and total housing stock:

| **Metro Area**            | **Homes Sold (Aug 2024–Feb 2025)** | **Total Housing Stock**       | **Turnover Rate** (8-month period) |

**Key takeaways:** According to Redfin’s analysis, **Phoenix** led all major metros with about *38 homes sold per 1,000 homes* in the first eight months of 2024 ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Phoenix%20saw%20the%20most%20turnover,35%20of%20every%201%2C000)) – roughly 3.8% of its housing stock. It was followed by **Newark, NJ** (~3.7%), **Nashville, TN** (~3.6%), **Tampa, FL** (~3.5%), and **Nassau County, NY** (~3.1%) ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Phoenix%20saw%20the%20most%20turnover,35%20of%20every%201%2C000))  ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Tampa%2C%20FL))  These areas had the **highest turnover rates** in the nation, despite the overall slowdown. Industry experts note that **Sun Belt markets** like Phoenix and Nashville remained relatively active, as they continued to attract buyers (e.g. remote workers seeking affordable living) ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Those%20same%20three%20cities%20also,living%20close%20to%20New%20York))  Similarly, **Newark and Nassau (Long Island)** benefited from demand for suburban housing near New York City, keeping turnover higher in those areas ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Those%20same%20three%20cities%20also,living%20close%20to%20New%20York))  

In contrast, many large coastal metros in California and the Northeast saw very low turnover (often **under 1.8%** for Aug 2024–Feb 2025). For example, **Los Angeles had the lowest turnover**, with only about *1.5% of homes* selling in the first eight months of 2024 ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=California%20contains%20seven%20of%20the,homes%20changing%20hands%20this%20year))  ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Los%20Angeles%2C%20CA))  This reflects factors like California’s tax policies (e.g. Prop 13) that **discourage moving** and the “lock-in effect” of homeowners holding onto ultra-low mortgage rates ([Home turnovers at their lowest level in 30 years](https://spectrumnews1.com/ca/southern-california/housing/2024/09/30/home-turnovers-are-at-their-lowest-level-in-30-years#:~:text=Los%20Angeles%20had%20the%20lowest,and%20Nassau%20County%2C%20New%20York))  ([According to Redfin, Merely 1% of U.S. Residences Have Transferred Ownership - Elite 100 Agents](https://elite100agents.com/according-to-redfin-merely-1-of-u-s-residences-have-transferred-ownership/#:~:text=The%20report%20noted%20that%20California%2C,owners%20in%20the%20past%20year))  

Overall, between August 2024 and February 2025 the **highest home-sales percentages** were concentrated in a few **high-churn markets** – notably **Phoenix, Nashville, Tampa, and parts of New Jersey/New York** – with **turnover rates around 3–4% of housing stock** ([Just 2.5% of U.S. Homes Changed Hands This Year, The Lowest Rate in Decades :: Redfin Corporation (RDFN)](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1183/just-2-5-of-u-s-homes-changed-hands-this-year-the-lowest#:~:text=Phoenix%20saw%20the%20most%20turnover,35%20of%20every%201%2C000))  These figures, sourced from reputable industry trackers like Redfin and Census data, highlight where housing market activity remained relatively robust even as nationwide sales hit record lows.

The above tables combine these reputable sources to spotlight the states and metro areas with the **greatest share of homes sold relative to total inventory**.
